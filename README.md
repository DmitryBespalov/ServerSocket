# Server socket in Swift
The project contains sample code that illustrates how to create a server socket in Swift. 

The server uses a self-signed certificate. In order for it to work, you should install the `Certificates/localhost.cer` file in the Simulator (drag and drop). 

The passphrase for the server's digital identity `Certificates/MyLocalServer.p12` is `123456`.

Tested on Swift 3.0, Xcode 8.2.1.
